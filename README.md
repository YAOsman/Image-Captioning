# Image-Captioning
Application that either reads frames fed by webcam and captions it, or reads images in a directory and recreates these images with added captions. Trained and used the model provided by: https://github.com/neural-nuts/image-caption-generator

Includes some example images and their captions from the run. I did not train the model very well so captions are not highly accurate.

Trained model and Decoder file are not included as they are too big. Their file paths should be adjusted according to their local file path.
